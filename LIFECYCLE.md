The user enters the room and switches on his/her app.
The app checks to see which other people have the app and identifies them.
Then, when the Pebble makes a handshaking movement, it sends a signal to its app, and if at least one another identified app is within a certain radius, then the app sends a LinkedIn request to the closest app.

FEATURES:
Check to make sure the person is not already a LinkedIn contact.
Handle arbitration of request sending: who sends? Random?
